    %choose one link and allocate all flows of STA to it 
else
    for each flow of that sta 
        if flow < x   (SLCI based allocation)
            %choose one link and allocate all flows of STA to it
        else 
            %divide flow into multiple links
        end
    end
end

i)How to choose the link?
ii)How to divide the flows?

->Which link offers chances of getting aggregated faster and hence transmitting faster?
This depends upon 
i)Queue size at each link
ii)No of packets of particular STA on each link (aggregation)
iii)Link Congestion/Channel Occupancy, which queue has smaller backoff
iv)BW, Rate
